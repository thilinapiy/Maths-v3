Maths-v3
========

Our project purpose is to provide basic mathematical knowledge to primary Sinhala medium students using creative
environments. Our Aim  is to provide  more reliable and  beneficial services to the students in order to remove 
inefficiencies in learning basic mathematics. Our software include basic mathematical functions such as addition, 
divition, substraction and multiplication. Those lessons are all taken from the current Srilankan school syllabus. 

As mentioned  earlier this has  been  provided to  Sinhala  medium  students  as a  solution for shortage of like 
this software. In addition  to  that this software  provides  a way  for students to develop their logical thinking 
rather being using normal text books.
